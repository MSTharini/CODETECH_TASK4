Overview of the Project

Objective:
This project explores two different text generation techniques: GPT-2 and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. The objective is to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. GPT-2, a transformer-based language model, is used for high-quality text generation, while an LSTM model is trained on custom text data to generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence.

Dataset Description:
For LSTM text generation, a small custom dataset is used, consisting of sentences about Artificial Intelligence in various industries (e.g., healthcare, education). This text serves as the corpus to train the LSTM model. The GPT-2 model, however, uses a pre-trained model from OpenAI, so no custom dataset is required for it.

Methodology Deployed:

GPT-2 Text Generation:

The generate_text_gpt2() function uses the GPT-2 pre-trained model and tokenizer from the transformers library to generate text based on a given prompt.
The model encodes the input prompt, generates a continuation of text using the GPT-2 architecture, and decodes the output back into human-readable text.
GPT-2's advanced capabilities allow it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a prompt, making it highly effective for creative writing and other applications.
LSTM Text Generation:

Data Preparation: The prepare_data_lstm() function tokenizes the input text into sequences of words. Each sequence represents a chunk of the text that will help the model predict the next word.
LSTM Model: The build_lstm_model() function constructs an LSTM model with an embedding layer, followed by LSTM layers and a final Dense layer to predict the next word in the sequence.
Training: The LSTM model is trained on sequences of words from the input text, learning to predict the next word based on the preceding words.
Text Generation: The generate_text_lstm() function uses the trained LSTM model to generate text by predicting the next word in the sequence repeatedly.
Training and Generation Process:

The LSTM model is trained on a small dataset with a fixed sequence length. Once trained, the model can generate new text by providing a seed text and predicting subsequent words.
The GPT-2 model, being pre-trained, does not require training and can immediately generate text from a prompt.
Expected Outcomes:

GPT-2 Generation: The GPT-2 model will generate high-quality, coherent text based on the input prompt.
LSTM Generation: The LSTM model will generate text that continues from the provided seed text, based on patterns learned from the training data.
Comparison: A comparison between the two methods will demonstrate the advantages of pre-trained models like GPT-2 for high-quality text generation and the versatility of LSTM models when trained on domain-specific data.
Key Insights and Recommendations:

GPT-2 is ideal for generating high-quality text when a pre-trained model is preferred, as it requires no custom training and can produce human-like text.
LSTM models, although requiring custom training, can be very effective when the dataset is highly specialized, as they can learn to generate text that matches specific patterns or styles.
The next steps could involve fine-tuning both models on domain-specific datasets to further enhance the quality of generated text, especially for more complex applications such as dialogue systems or content generation.
